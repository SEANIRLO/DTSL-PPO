# DTSL-PPO
## Introduction
* This is the code repository for the solution 'DTSL-PPO: A Well-Tailored Deep Reinforcement Learning Model to Highly Profit in Futures Trading Market' to 'Trading Strategies', the problem C of MCM 2022.
* This solution was a ***Finalist (Top 2%)*** Awardee.

## Overview
* We modeled a series of trading conditions and operations as Markov Decision Process (MDP) and innovatively trained the trading agent with PPO algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL);
* We designed Dynamic T-period Sliding Window PPO (DTSL-PPO) algorithm with trading agents focusing respectively on long and short terms coordinating together, so as to initiate trading quickly with a relatively insufficient amount of data and perceive the market more precisely;
* We gave analyses to the performance of our model. The performance of agents trained by our algorithm was satisfying.
